A Java-based banking app that allows users to transfer money anonymously, purchase virtual credit cards, drop cash at specific locations, and view a history of all transactions.

Here is the translated text:

Since the database resources are provided by my university, non-university members cannot log into the banking app because a VPN is required, which is only accessible to 
students of my university. However, all the code files used to program the entire app can be seen here. The code can also be easily downloaded, and the database connection 
can be changed, and then the app will work perfectly.
